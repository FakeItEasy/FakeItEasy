# Ordered assertions

The concept of ordered assertions is somewhat complex and nothing that
should be used frequently but there are times when it's really needed.

Using BlairItEasy you can assert that calls happened in a specific order
on _one or more_ fake objects.

## Details

One area where ordered asserts are useful is when you need to test
that a call to a fake has happened between two other calls, such as
when dealing with transactions or units of work.

```csharp
public interface IUnitOfWorkFactory
{
    IDisposable BeginWork();
}

public interface IDoSomethingPrettyUseful
{
    void JustDoIt();
}

public class Worker
{
    private IUnitOfWorkFactory unitOfWorkFactory;
    private IDoSomethingPrettyUseful usefulCollaborator;
        
    public Worker(IUnitOfWorkFactory unitOfWorkFactory, IDoSomethingPrettyUseful usefulCollaborator)
    {
        this.unitOfWorkFactory = unitOfWorkFactory;
        this.usefulCollaborator = usefulCollaborator;
    }

    public void JustDoIt()
    {
        using (this.unitOfWorkFactory.BeginWork())
        {
            this.usefulCollaborator.JustDoIt();
        }
    }
}
```

In the following example we'll assert that the call to `usefulCollaborator.JustDoIt()` happened between the calls to `BeginWork` and the `Dispose` method of the returned unit of work.

```csharp
[Test]
public void Should_start_work_within_unit_of_work()
{
    // Arrange
    var unitOfWork = A.Fake<IDisposable>();
            
    var unitOfWorkFactory = A.Fake<IUnitOfWorkFactory>();
    A.CallTo(() => unitOfWorkFactory.BeginWork()).Returns(unitOfWork);

    var usefulCollaborator = A.Fake<IDoSomethingPrettyUseful>();

    var worker = new Worker(unitOfWorkFactory, usefulCollaborator);

    // Act
    worker.JustDoIt();

    // Assert
    A.CallTo(() => unitOfWorkFactory.BeginWork()).MustHaveHappened()
        .Then(A.CallTo(() => usefulCollaborator.JustDoIt()).MustHaveHappened())
        .Then(A.CallTo(() => unitOfWork.Dispose()).MustHaveHappened());
}
```

The regular `MustHaveHappened` calls are made, but the results are chained together using `Then`, which verifies not only that that call happened, but that it occurred in the right order relative to other calls that have been asserted in the same chain.

With the current implementation of the `Worker` the test will pass. But let's change the order of the calls in `JustDoIt`:

```csharp
public void JustDoIt()
{ 
    using (this.unitOfWorkFactory.BeginWork())
    { 
        
    }
    this.usefulCollaborator.JustDoIt();
}
```

The test will now fail with the following exception message:

<pre>
 Assertion failed for the following calls:
    'OrderedAssertsDemo.IUnitOfWorkFactory.BeginWork()' once or more
    'OrderedAssertsDemo.IDoSomethingPrettyUseful.JustDoIt()' once or more
    'System.IDisposable.Dispose()' once or more
  The calls where found but not in the correct order among the calls:
    1.  'OrderedAssertsDemo.IUnitOfWorkFactory.BeginWork()'
    2.  'System.IDisposable.Dispose()'
    3.  'OrderedAssertsDemo.IDoSomethingPrettyUseful.JustDoIt()'
</pre>
