A .Net dynamic fake framework for creating all types of fake objects, mocks, stubs etc.

* Easier semantics, all fake objects are just that - fakes - the use of the fakes determines whether they're mocks or stubs.
* Context-aware fluent interface guides the developer.
* Designed for ease of use.
* Full compatibility with both C# and VB.Net.

## It's faking amazing!
